## Synopsis of Project

I struggled a lot with this project. I'm not sure why as I understood most everything we covered in the classwork and discussion together. I leaned heavily on the following resources:

1. Simon Kingaby
2. ChatGPT
3. XPert Learning Assistant
4. Two tutoring sessions
5. Ask BCS Learning Assistant
6. Collaboration with classmates
7. Class notes and Zoom videos
