## Synopsis of Project

I struggled a lot with this project. I'm not sure why as I understood most everything we covered in the classwork and discussion together. I leaned heavily on the following resources:

1. Simon Kingaby
2. ChatGPT
3. XPert Learning Assistant
4. Two tutoring sessions
5. Ask BCS Learning Assistant
6. Collaboration with classmates
7. Class notes and Zoom videos

# Overview

As mentioned above, I really struggled with understanding and executing this project. The problem with the project was breaking down the project into digestable pieces rather than wrapping my head around the projects entirety. I then started using ChatGPT and asking specific questions related to the project. I got the project to a point where the first spreadsheet was working. Unfrotunately, the others were not. I then requested the help of my classmates that helped me understand where the error in my code was. I then continued to use XPert as well as my instructor. Unfortunately, they were unable to help me with the problem I was having with the code. That problem was having the code cycle through all of the worksheets in the workbook. I employed the assistance of two tutors who could not help me either. I was a little shocked and disappointed as these are the people we are supposed to rely on for help in these situations. It was with the second tutor when he mentioned trying Ask BCS. I had not thought of this resource before as I had forgotten about it. So I reached out with my question through Ask BCS. The person I got was very nice and somewhat helpful. My code now cycles through the whole spreadsheet providing the values and the conditional formatting except for the Q4 sheet. I have spent over 30 hours on this project and I am just tired. I don't have the capacity to continue looking for a needle in a haystack. I'm sure my error is something small. But again, I am tired, and I have looked at this code and this spreadsheet for at least 30 hours. I would love to hear the feedback for why my code isn't running properly through the fourth spreadsheet. The Ask BCS person told me to add a fifth spreadsheet to my workbook and it would run perfectly. I did. Funny thing is, all sheets including sheet 5 formatted perfectly. Q4 sheet did not. Please let me know what in my code is keeping me from formatting the Q4 sheet properly.
